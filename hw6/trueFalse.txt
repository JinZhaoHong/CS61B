1. T Binary put
2. T Binary put
3. F Binary put, should be log(N)
4. T Binary put, log(N) < N
5. T Binary put, log(N) < N^2
6. F Binary put, should be log(N)
7. T Binary put, because it is running B.containsKey() two times,  it's 2*log(N)
8. O(N*Log(N)) Each time numberofNodes is called, takes O(N), The numberofNodes is called log(N) times
